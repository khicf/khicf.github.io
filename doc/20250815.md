# Summary of Completed Tasks (2025-08-15)

This report summarizes the tasks completed on August 15, 2025.

## 1. Make Event Time Optional

The event time field was made optional to allow for the creation of full-day events without a specific time.

* Modified the `Event` model in the database schema to make the `time` field optional.
* Updated the event creation and editing forms in the admin panel to remove the "required" attribute from the time input field.
* Updated the event display pages to conditionally render the event time only if it is available.

## 2. Private Features

Implemented a role-based access control system and created private features accessible only to specific users.

* **User Roles:**
  * Added a `role` field to the `User` model with possible values `USER` and `ADMIN`.
  * Updated the admin panel to allow administrators to manage user roles.
* **Photo Album:**
  * Created a "Photo Album" feature accessible only to administrators.
  * Admins can upload photos with captions.
  * The photo gallery displays all uploaded photos.
* **Appreciation Wall:**
  * Created an "Appreciation Wall" accessible only to authenticated users.
  * Users can post and view messages of appreciation.

## 3. Login System with Email Signup

Implemented a user authentication system with email and password, including a signup feature.

* **Signup Page:**
  * Created a new page at `/signup` for users to create a new account.
* **Signup API:**
  * Created a new API route at `/api/signup` to handle user creation.
* **Login Page:**
  * Updated the login page to include a link to the signup page.
* **Navigation:**
  * Added "Login" and "Logout" buttons to the navigation bar, which are displayed conditionally based on the user's authentication status.

Project: Photo Album Feature Implementation

  Summary of Completed Tasks:

* Photo Album Location Identified: Confirmed the primary photo album interface is
     implemented at app/photos/page.js.
* Enabled Photo Upload for All Authenticated Users:
  * Modified app/api/photos/route.js to remove administrative role restrictions on
         photo upload functionality.
  * Updated app/photos/page.js to ensure the photo upload form is displayed to all
         authenticated users.
* Photo Album Visibility Extended to All Authenticated Users:
  * Adjusted app/photos/page.js to eliminate redirection for authenticated non-admin
         users, allowing them to access the photo album.
  * Refactored rendering logic in app/photos/page.js to ensure the photo album content
         is always visible to authenticated users, irrespective of their assigned role.
* Resolved Photo Upload `userId` Error:
  * Implemented a fix within the session callback in
         app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js to guarantee that session.user.id is
         consistently populated, resolving the Argument user is missing error during photo
         creation.
  * Removed temporary debugging console.log statements from app/api/photos/route.js.

  Outstanding Issue:

* Photos are successfully uploaded to the public/uploads directory but are not currently
     rendering or appearing on the app/photos/page.js interface. This issue was in the
     process of being debugged.
