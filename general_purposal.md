# Project Summary

This project is a website for the International Christian Fellowship (ICF) community. It allows members to share and view events, prayer requests, and scripture passages. The website is built with Next.js and uses a PostgreSQL database with Prisma as the ORM. Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js. 

## Key Features

* **Events:** Users can view a list of upcoming events, including details like date, time, location, and description. An admin panel allows authorized users to create, edit, and delete events.
* **Prayer Wall:** Users can post prayer requests and view requests from others. They can also add comments to prayer requests. An admin panel allows for the moderation of prayer requests.
* **Scripture Sharing:** Users can share scripture passages with the community. An admin panel allows for the management of shared scriptures.
* **Admin Panel:** A dedicated admin section allows authorized users to manage all content on the website, including events, prayer requests, and scriptures.

# Future Features

Here are some potential features that could be added to the website:

* **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles with their name, a short bio, and a profile picture. This would help to build a stronger sense of community.

TODO:
- Time of events should be optional. So users can create full day events without specifying a time.
- Create private features that are only visible to certain users.
 - photo album (let people upload photos)
 - appreciation wall (let people chat)
