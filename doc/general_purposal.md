# Project Summary

This project is a website for the International Christian Fellowship (ICF) community. It allows members to share and view events, prayer requests, and scripture passages. The website is built with Next.js and uses a PostgreSQL database with Prisma as the ORM. Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js.

## Key Features

* **Events:** Users can view a list of upcoming events, including details like date, time, location, and description. An admin panel allows authorized users to create, edit, and delete events. The event time field is optional to allow for the creation of full-day events.
* **Prayer Wall:** Users can post prayer requests and view requests from others. They can also add comments to prayer requests. An admin panel allows for the moderation of prayer requests.
* **Scripture Sharing:** Users can share scripture passages with the community. An admin panel allows for the management of shared scriptures.
* **Admin Panel:** A dedicated admin section allows authorized users to manage all content on the website, including events, prayer requests, and scriptures.
* **User Authentication:** A user authentication system with email and password, including a signup feature.

* **Appreciation Wall:** An appreciation wall accessible to authenticated users, where they can post and view messages of appreciation.

**Privacy and Access Control Implementation:**

* **Admin-Only Access:** Implemented role-based access control for the admin panel. The pages `/admin` and `/admin/users` are now only accessible to users with the `ADMIN` role. Unauthorized users are redirected.
* **Member-Only Access:** The "Prayer Wall" (`/prayer`) and "Appreciation Wall" (`/appreciation`) pages are now accessible only to authenticated users. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
* **Public Login Page:** Created a dedicated, public login page at `/login` to separate it from the admin panel.
